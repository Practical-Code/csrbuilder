## Continuous Integration

 - [Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wbond/csrbuilder/history) via AppVeyor
 - [OS X](https://circleci.com/gh/wbond/csrbuilder) via CircleCI
 - [Linux](https://travis-ci.org/wbond/csrbuilder/builds) via Travis CI
 - [Test Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/wbond/csrbuilder/commits) via Codecov

## Testing

Tests are written using `unittest` and require no third-party packages:

```bash
python run.py tests
```

To run only some tests, pass a regular expression as a parameter to `tests`.

```bash
python run.py tests build
```

## Development

To install the package used for linting, execute:

```bash
pip install --user -r requires/lint
```

The following command will run the linter:

```bash
python run.py lint
```

Support for code coverage can be installed via:

```bash
pip install --user -r requires/coverage
```

Coverage is measured by running:

```bash
python run.py coverage
```

To install the packages requires to generate the API documentation, run:

```bash
pip install --user -r requires/api_docs
```

The documentation can then be generated by running:

```bash
python run.py api_docs
```

To install the necessary packages for releasing a new version on PyPI, run:

```bash
pip install --user -r requires/release
```

Releases are created by:

 - Making a git tag in [semver](http://semver.org/) format
 - Running the command:

   ```bash
   python run.py release
   ```

Existing releases can be found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/csrbuilder.

## CI Tasks

A task named `deps` exists to ensure a modern version of `pip` is installed,
along with all necessary testing dependencies.

The `ci` task runs `lint` (if flake8 is avaiable for the version of Python) and
`coverage` (or `tests` if coverage is not available for the version of Python).
If the current directory is a clean git working copy, the coverage data is
submitted to codecov.io.

```bash
python run.py deps
python run.py ci
```
